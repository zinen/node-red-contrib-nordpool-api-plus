A Node-Red Node for collecting "day ahead" prices from Nord Pool Group.  
Hourly and daily prices are retrieved.

*This is a fork of the original node-red-contrib-nordpool-api, but with source code on github to make pull request possible and issue handling. Later that year: the original code is now [uploaded here](https://github.com/Csstenersen/node-red-contrib-nordpool-api)*

## Installation
Go to your Node-RED user folder (e.g. ~/.node-red) and run:
```
npm i node-red-contrib-nordpool-api-plus
```
This node uses the unofficial nordpool API [found here](https://github.com/samuelmr/nordpool-node).

## Usage


The area and currency can be changed by selecting from the drop down menu in the properties, or by inputting the setting via a `msg`:

### Examples:
Use a inject node to trigger a request to nordpool, to get prices for today.

Its also possible to inject a `msg.date` to get price from a specific date, or pricing for tomorrow. If you request tomorrows data before 14:42 there's a risk that data is not available yet and you will get the data from the current date. See [API issue#1](https://github.com/samuelmr/nordpool-node/issues/1#issuecomment-316583765)

Hourly and daily prices are returned on separate outputs.

Hourly prices are returned in a 24 object long array on success.  
Daily prices are returned in an array 31 objects long (i.e. roughly for the past month).

Objects for hourly and daily prices have the same properties: `timestamp`, `price`, `currency` and `area`.

## Example with dashboard chart:
In Node-RED editor, click menu at top right corner -> Import -> Examples -> node-red-contrib-nordpool-api-plus -> basic-dashboard.

Use a function node to convert `msg` to values readable for dashboard chart node like this:

The function node in this example contains:

````
var msg1 = {}
for (var i = 0; i<msg.payload.length;i++){
    msg1 = {
        topic:msg.payload[i].currency, 
        payload:msg.payload[i].price, 
        timestamp:msg.payload[i].timestamp,
    }
    node.send(msg1)
}
````

This could be the displayed result in:
